## Previous Works

### [Handwashing education site](https://nsw-students-mental-health.glitch.me/)

Working with UNSW, this is a special project helping children, parents and teachers alike accessing important resources to prevent COVID-19.

Beside creating website and building an interactive quiz, I have also assisted in research and completing the website's content.

### [Duty Robin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thomassth.dutyrobin)

Finally, an app that helps first-line workers adding and visualizing their shifting schedules. 

(You won't believe how many workarounds we needed to come up with!)

Available on Android. iOS coming soon.

### [Anyone In There](https://thomassth.github.io/AnyoneInThere/)

Tiny web app. Indicates a room is occupied or not (manually).

Running on Heroku with Cloudinary for remote storage. Not working on GitHub.

### [Podcast to video](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NZXCK5WDCXC)

UWP wrapper for an FFMPEG formula.
Merging 1 audio and 1 image to 1 video (ie. Podcast publishing). 
Now on Microsoft Store.

### [News ticker](https://thomassth.github.io/CR002/) 

Suitable for OBS studio.

Instead of slowly scrolling past, each headline is shown for a few seconds, then to the next. 

Minimalist theming, like FranceInfo instead of CNN.
